Jeff: Today is the day of the uprising...
Jeff: I wonder which side will win,
Jeff: I should go see what is happening.

Bert: (Bert looks happy to see you!)

Imp: Nice weapon. Not many ones like that around here.
Imp: Be careful what you shoot. If you shoot me i'll smash your face off.
Imp: Kill the guy above us instead...
Imp: We must overthrow those dumb skeletons!
Imp: Join the revolution! Or perish.

Skeleton: Stay away from the box!
Skeleton: This box contains crucial supplies to survive!
Skeleton: The imps are trying to destroy them...
Skeleton: Those imps should be banished!

Skeleton: Those imps are threatening to destroy our buildings!
Skeleton: You have a strong weapon, you can help us! 
Skeleton: Please help!

Imp: Hey you! Guy with fancy weapon! Yes you!
Imp: Help us take the city!
Imp: We Imps have been neglected for too long!

Imp: We are going to defeat those skeletons once and for all.
Imp: Help us and we will repay you!

Imp: Nothing to see in this building.

Skeleton: Rumor says the imps have been planning something in the abandoned building.
Skeleton: I don't think they have noticed me here yet.

Bar Owner: You aren't here to kill us are you?
Bar Owner: Man... owning a bar is tough these days...

Imp: Heh heh I managed to sneak in! I'm going to make a ruckus.
Imp: Don't you dare tell the bar owner.

Skeleton: The atmosphere is dead, is there an important event today or something?

Bar Owner: There's an Imp hiding in the back of the bar?
Bar Owner: Thanks for telling me! I will deal with it...
Bar Owner: I will make sure the skeletons know you helped me!

Bar Owner: Looks like you already killed him, thanks for helping!
Bar Owner: The skeletons know you helped me!
Bar Owner: I have disposed of the imp.
Bar Owner: The skeletons know you helped me!
